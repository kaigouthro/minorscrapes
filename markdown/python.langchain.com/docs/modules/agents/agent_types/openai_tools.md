# OpenAI tools

With LCEL we can easily construct agents that take advantage of OpenAI parallel function calling (a.k.a. tool calling).

[code]
```python




    # !pip install -U openai duckduckgo-search  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent  
    from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad.openai_tools import (  
        format_to_openai_tool_messages,  
    )  
    from langchain.agents.output_parsers.openai_tools import OpenAIToolsAgentOutputParser  
    from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI  
    from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder  
    from langchain.tools import BearlyInterpreterTool, DuckDuckGoSearchRun  
    from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_tool  
    


```
[/code]


## Tools​

For this agent let's give it the ability to search DuckDuckGo and use Bearly's code interpreter. You'll need a Bearly API key, which you can get here.

[code]
```python




    lc_tools = [DuckDuckGoSearchRun(), BearlyInterpreterTool(api_key="...").as_tool()]  
    oai_tools = [format_tool_to_openai_tool(tool) for tool in lc_tools]  
    


```
[/code]


## Prompt template​

We need to make sure we have a user input message and an "agent_scratchpad" messages placeholder, which is where the AgentExecutor will track AI messages invoking tools and Tool messages returning the
tool output.

[code]
```python




    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(  
        [  
            ("system", "You are a helpful assistant"),  
            ("user", "{input}"),  
            MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="agent_scratchpad"),  
        ]  
    )  
    


```
[/code]


## Model​

Only certain models support parallel function calling, so make sure you're using a compatible model.

[code]
```python




    llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106")  
    


```
[/code]


## Agent​

We use the `OpenAIToolsAgentOutputParser` to convert the tool calls returned by the model into `AgentAction`s objects that our `AgentExecutor` can then route to the appropriate tool.

[code]
```python




    agent = (  
        {  
            "input": lambda x: x["input"],  
            "agent_scratchpad": lambda x: format_to_openai_tool_messages(  
                x["intermediate_steps"]  
            ),  
        }  
        | prompt  
        | llm.bind(tools=oai_tools)  
        | OpenAIToolsAgentOutputParser()  
    )  
    


```
[/code]


## Agent executor​

[code]
```python




    agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=lc_tools, verbose=True)  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




        ['memory', 'callbacks', 'callback_manager', 'verbose', 'tags', 'metadata', 'agent', 'tools', 'return_intermediate_steps', 'max_iterations', 'max_execution_time', 'early_stopping_method', 'handle_parsing_errors', 'trim_intermediate_steps']  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    agent_executor.invoke(  
        {"input": "What's the average of the temperatures in LA, NYC, and SF today?"}  
    )  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python
