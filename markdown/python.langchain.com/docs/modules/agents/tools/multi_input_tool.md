# Multi-Input Tools

This notebook shows how to use a tool that requires multiple inputs with an agent. The recommended way to do so is with the `StructuredTool` class.

[code]
```python




    import os  
      
    os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING"] = "true"  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent  
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI  
      
    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    from langchain.tools import StructuredTool  
      
      
    def multiplier(a: float, b: float) -> float:  
        """Multiply the provided floats."""  
        return a * b  
      
      
    tool = StructuredTool.from_function(multiplier)  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    # Structured tools are compatible with the STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION agent type.  
    agent_executor = initialize_agent(  
        [tool],  
        llm,  
        agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,  
        verbose=True,  
    )  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    agent_executor.run("What is 3 times 4")  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




          
          
        > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...  
          
        Thought: I need to multiply 3 and 4  
        Action:  
        ```  
        {  
          "action": "multiplier",  
          "action_input": {"a": 3, "b": 4}  
        }  
        ```  
          
        Observation: 12  
        Thought: I know what to respond  
        Action:  
        ```  
        {  
          "action": "Final Answer",  
          "action_input": "3 times 4 is 12"  
        }  
        ```  
          
        > Finished chain.  
      
      
      
      
      
        '3 times 4 is 12'  
    


```
[/code]


## Multi-Input Tools with a string formatâ€‹

An alternative to the structured tool would be to use the regular `Tool` class and accept a single string. The tool would then have to handle the parsing logic to extract the relevant values from the
text, which tightly couples the tool representation to the agent prompt. This is still useful if the underlying language model can't reliably generate structured schema.

Let's take the multiplication function as an example. In order to use this, we will tell the agent to generate the "Action Input" as a comma-separated list of length two. We will then write a thin
wrapper that takes a string, splits it into two around a comma, and passes both parsed sides as integers to the multiplication function.

[code]
```python




    from langchain.agents import AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent  
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI  
    


```
[/code]


Here is the multiplication function, as well as a wrapper to parse a string as input.

[code]
```python




    def multiplier(a, b):  
        return a * b  
      
      
    def parsing_multiplier(string):  
        a, b = string.split(",")  
        return multiplier(int(a), int(b))  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)  
    tools = [  
        Tool(  
            name="Multiplier",  
            func=parsing_multiplier,  
            description="useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together. The input to this tool should be a comma separated list of numbers of length two, representing the two numbers you want to multiply together. For example, `1,2` would be the input if you wanted to multiply 1 by 2.",  
        )  
    ]  
    mrkl = initialize_agent(  
        tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True  
    )  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    mrkl.run("What is 3 times 4")  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




          
          
        > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...  
         I need to multiply two numbers  
        Action: Multiplier  
        Action Input: 3,4  
        Observation: 12  
        Thought: I now know the final answer  
        Final Answer: 3 times 4 is 12  
          
        > Finished chain.  
      
      
      
      
      
        '3 times 4 is 12'  
    


```
[/code]
