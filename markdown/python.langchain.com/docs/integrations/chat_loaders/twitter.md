# Twitter (via Apify)

This notebook shows how to load chat messages from Twitter to fine-tune on. We do this by utilizing Apify.

First, use Apify to export tweets. An example

```python




    import json

    from langchain.adapters.openai import convert_message_to_dict
    from langchain.schema import AIMessage



```


```python




    with open("example_data/dataset_twitter-scraper_2023-08-23_22-13-19-740.json") as f:
        data = json.load(f)



```


```python




    # Filter out tweets that reference other tweets, because it's a bit weird
    tweets = [d["full_text"] for d in data if "t.co" not in d["full_text"]]
    # Create them as AI messages
    messages = [AIMessage(content=t) for t in tweets]
    # Add in a system message at the start
    # TODO: we could try to extract the subject from the tweets, and put that in the system message.
    system_message = {"role": "system", "content": "write a tweet"}
    data = [[system_message, convert_message_to_dict(m)] for m in messages]



```
