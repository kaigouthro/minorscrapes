# Trubrics

Trubrics is an LLM user analytics platform that lets you collect, analyse and manage user prompts & feedback on AI models. In this guide we will go over how to setup the `TrubricsCallbackHandler`.

Check out our repo for more information on Trubrics.

## Installation and Setupâ€‹

```python




    pip install trubrics



```


### Getting Trubrics Credentialsâ€‹

If you do not have a Trubrics account, create one on here. In this tutorial, we will use the `default` project that is built upon account creation.

Now set your credentials as environment variables:

```python




    import os

    os.environ["TRUBRICS_EMAIL"] = "***@***"
    os.environ["TRUBRICS_PASSWORD"] = "***"



```


### Usageâ€‹

The `TrubricsCallbackHandler` can receive various optional arguments. See here for kwargs that can be passed to Trubrics prompts.

```python




    class TrubricsCallbackHandler(BaseCallbackHandler):

        """
        Callback handler for Trubrics.

        Args:
            project: a trubrics project, default project is "default"
            email: a trubrics account email, can equally be set in env variables
            password: a trubrics account password, can equally be set in env variables
            **kwargs: all other kwargs are parsed and set to trubrics prompt variables, or added to the `metadata` dict
        """



```


## Examplesâ€‹

Here are two examples of how to use the `TrubricsCallbackHandler` with Langchain LLMs or Chat Models. We will use OpenAI models, so set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` key here:

```python




    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-***"



```


### 1\. With an LLMâ€‹

```python




    from langchain.callbacks import TrubricsCallbackHandler
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI



```


```python




    llm = OpenAI(callbacks=[TrubricsCallbackHandler()])



```

```python




    print("--> GPT's joke: ", res.generations[0][0].text)
    print()
    print("--> GPT's poem: ", res.generations[1][0].text)



```


```python




        --> GPT's joke:

        Q: What did the fish say when it hit the wall?
        A: Dam!

        --> GPT's poem:

        A Poem of Reflection

        I stand here in the night,
        The stars above me filling my sight.
        I feel such a deep connection,
        To the world and all its perfection.

        A moment of clarity,
        The calmness in the air so serene.
        My mind is filled with peace,
        And I am released.

        The past and the present,
        My thoughts create a pleasant sentiment.
        My heart is full of joy,
        My soul soars like a toy.

        I reflect on my life,
        And the choices I have made.
        My struggles and my strife,
        The lessons I have paid.

        The future is a mystery,
        But I am ready to take the leap.
        I am ready to take the lead,
        And to create my own destiny.



```


### 2\. With a chat modelâ€‹

```python




    from langchain.callbacks import TrubricsCallbackHandler
    from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
    from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage



```


```python




    chat_llm = ChatOpenAI(
        callbacks=[
            TrubricsCallbackHandler(
                project="default",
                tags=["chat model"],
                user_id="user-id-1234",
                some_metadata={"hello": [1, 2]},
            )
        ]
    )



```


```python




    chat_res = chat_llm(
        [
            SystemMessage(content="Every answer of yours must be about OpenAI."),
            HumanMessage(content="Tell me a joke"),
        ]
    )



```


```python




        [32m2023-09-26 11:30:10.550[0m | [1mINFO    [0m | [36mtrubrics.platform[0m:[36mlog_prompt[0m:[36m102[0m - [1mUser prompt saved to Trubrics.[0m



```


```python




    print(chat_res.content)



```


```python




        Why did the OpenAI computer go to the party?

        Because it wanted to meet its AI friends and have a byte of fun!



```
