# Weaviate Hybrid Search

> Weaviate is an open-source vector database.

> Hybrid search is a technique that combines multiple search algorithms to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results. It uses the best features of both keyword-based search algorithms with
> vector search techniques.

> The `Hybrid search in Weaviate` uses sparse and dense vectors to represent the meaning and context of search queries and documents.

This notebook shows how to use `Weaviate hybrid search` as a LangChain retriever.

Set up the retriever:

[code]
```python




    #!pip install weaviate-client  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    import os  
      
    import weaviate  
      
    WEAVIATE_URL = os.getenv("WEAVIATE_URL")  
    auth_client_secret = (weaviate.AuthApiKey(api_key=os.getenv("WEAVIATE_API_KEY")),)  
    client = weaviate.Client(  
        url=WEAVIATE_URL,  
        additional_headers={  
            "X-Openai-Api-Key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),  
        },  
    )  
      
    # client.schema.delete_all()  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    from langchain.retrievers.weaviate_hybrid_search import WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever  
    from langchain.schema import Document  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




          
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    retriever = WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever(  
        client=client,  
        index_name="LangChain",  
        text_key="text",  
        attributes=[],  
        create_schema_if_missing=True,  
    )  
    


```
[/code]


Add some data:

[code]
```python

```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    retriever.add_documents(docs)  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python
