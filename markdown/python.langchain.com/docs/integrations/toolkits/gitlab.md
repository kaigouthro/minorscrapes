# Gitlab

The `Gitlab` toolkit contains tools that enable an LLM agent to interact with a gitlab repository. The tool is a wrapper for the python-gitlab library.

## Quickstart​

  1. Install the python-gitlab library
  2. Create a Gitlab personal access token
  3. Set your environmental variables
  4. Pass the tools to your agent with `toolkit.get_tools()`

Each of these steps will be explained in great detail below.

  1.  **Get Issues** \- fetches issues from the repository.

  2.  **Get Issue** \- fetches details about a specific issue.

  3.  **Comment on Issue** \- posts a comment on a specific issue.

  4.  **Create Pull Request** \- creates a pull request from the bot's working branch to the base branch.

  5.  **Create File** \- creates a new file in the repository.

  6.  **Read File** \- reads a file from the repository.

  7.  **Update File** \- updates a file in the repository.

  8.  **Delete File** \- deletes a file from the repository.

## Setup​

### 1\. Install the `python-gitlab` library​

[code]
```python




    %pip install python-gitlab  
    


```
[/code]


### 2\. Create a Gitlab personal access token​

Follow the instructions here to create a Gitlab personal access token. Make sure your app has the following repository permissions:

  * read_api
  * read_repository
  * write_repository

### 3\. Set Environmental Variables​

Before initializing your agent, the following environmental variables need to be set:

  *  **GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN** \- The personal access token you created in the last step
  *  **GITLAB_REPOSITORY** \- The name of the Gitlab repository you want your bot to act upon. Must follow the format {username}/{repo-name}.
  *  **GITLAB_BRANCH** \- The branch where the bot will make its commits. Defaults to 'main.'
  *  **GITLAB_BASE_BRANCH** \- The base branch of your repo, usually either 'main' or 'master.' This is where pull requests will base from. Defaults to 'main.'

## Example: Simple Agent​

[code]
```python




    import os  
      
    from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent  
    from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.gitlab.toolkit import GitLabToolkit  
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI  
    from langchain.utilities.gitlab import GitLabAPIWrapper  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    # Set your environment variables using os.environ  
    os.environ["GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"] = ""  
    os.environ["GITLAB_REPOSITORY"] = "username/repo-name"  
    os.environ["GITLAB_BRANCH"] = "bot-branch-name"  
    os.environ["GITLAB_BASE_BRANCH"] = "main"  
      
    # This example also requires an OpenAI API key  
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)  
    gitlab = GitLabAPIWrapper()  
    toolkit = GitLabToolkit.from_gitlab_api_wrapper(gitlab)  
    agent = initialize_agent(  
        toolkit.get_tools(), llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True  
    )  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    agent.run(  
        "You have the software engineering capabilities of a Google Principle engineer. You are tasked with completing issues on a gitlab repository. Please look at the open issues and complete them by creating pull requests that solve the issues."  
    )  
    


```
[/code]

```python
