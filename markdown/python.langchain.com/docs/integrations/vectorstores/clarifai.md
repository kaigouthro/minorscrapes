# Clarifai

> Clarifai is an AI Platform that provides the full AI lifecycle ranging from data exploration, data labeling, model training, evaluation, and inference. A Clarifai application can be used as a vector
> database after uploading inputs.

This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `Clarifai` vector database. Examples are shown to demonstrate text semantic search capabilities. Clarifai also supports semantic search with
images, video frames, and localized search (see Rank) and attribute search (see Filter).

To use Clarifai, you must have an account and a Personal Access Token (PAT) key. Check here to get or create a PAT.

# Dependencies

[code]
```python




    # Install required dependencies  
    pip install clarifai  
    


```
[/code]


# Imports

Here we will be setting the personal access token. You can find your PAT under settings/security on the platform.

[code]
```python




    # Please login and get your API key from  https://clarifai.com/settings/security  
    from getpass import getpass  
      
    CLARIFAI_PAT = getpass()  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




         ········  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    # Import the required modules  
    from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader  
    from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter  
    from langchain.vectorstores import Clarifai  
    


```
[/code]


# Setup

Setup the user id and app id where the text data will be uploaded. Note: when creating that application please select an appropriate base workflow for indexing your text documents such as the
Language-Understanding workflow.

You will have to first create an account on Clarifai and then create an application.

[code]
```python




    USER_ID = "USERNAME_ID"  
    APP_ID = "APPLICATION_ID"  
    NUMBER_OF_DOCS = 4  
    


```
[/code]


## From Texts​

Create a Clarifai vectorstore from a list of texts. This section will upload each text with its respective metadata to a Clarifai Application. The Clarifai Application can then be used for semantic
search to find relevant texts.

[code]
```python




    texts = [  
        "I really enjoy spending time with you",  
        "I hate spending time with my dog",  
        "I want to go for a run",  
        "I went to the movies yesterday",  
        "I love playing soccer with my friends",  
    ]  
      
    metadatas = [  
        {"id": i, "text": text, "source": "book 1", "category": ["books", "modern"]}  
        for i, text in enumerate(texts)  
    ]  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    clarifai_vector_db = Clarifai.from_texts(  
        user_id=USER_ID,  
        app_id=APP_ID,  
        texts=texts,  
        pat=CLARIFAI_PAT,  
        number_of_docs=NUMBER_OF_DOCS,  
        metadatas=metadatas,  
    )  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    docs = clarifai_vector_db.similarity_search("I would love to see you")  
    docs  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




        [Document(page_content='I really enjoy spending time with you', metadata={'text': 'I really enjoy spending time with you', 'id': 0.0, 'source': 'book 1', 'category': ['books', 'modern']}),  
         Document(page_content='I went to the movies yesterday', metadata={'text': 'I went to the movies yesterday', 'id': 3.0, 'source': 'book 1', 'category': ['books', 'modern']})]  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    # There is lots powerful filtering you can do within an app by leveraging metadata filters.  
    # This one will limit the similarity query to only the texts that have key of "source" matching value of "book 1"  
    book1_similar_docs = clarifai_vector_db.similarity_search(  
        "I would love to see you", filter={"source": "book 1"}  
    )  
      
    # you can also use lists in the input's metadata and then select things that match an item in the list. This is useful for categories like below:  
    book_category_similar_docs = clarifai_vector_db.similarity_search(  
        "I would love to see you", filter={"category": ["books"]}  
    )  
    


```
[/code]


## From Documents​

Create a Clarifai vectorstore from a list of Documents. This section will upload each document with its respective metadata to a Clarifai Application. The Clarifai Application can then be used for
semantic search to find relevant documents.

[code]
```python




    loader = TextLoader("../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt")  
    documents = loader.load()  
    text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)  
    docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python




    docs[:4]  
    


```
[/code]


[code]
```python

## From existing App​

Within Clarifai we have great tools for adding data to applications (essentially projects) via API or UI. Most users will already have done that before interacting with LangChain so this example will
use the data in an existing app to perform searches. Check out our API docs and UI docs. The Clarifai Application can then be used for semantic search to find relevant documents.

```python




    USER_ID = "USERNAME_ID"  
    APP_ID = "APPLICATION_ID"  
    NUMBER_OF_DOCS = 4
