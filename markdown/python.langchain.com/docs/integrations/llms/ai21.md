# AI21

AI21 Studio provides API access to `Jurassic-2` large language models.

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with AI21 models.

```python




    # install the package:
    pip install ai21



```


```python




    # get AI21_API_KEY. Use https://studio.ai21.com/account/account

    from getpass import getpass

    AI21_API_KEY = getpass()



```


```python




         ········



```


```python




    from langchain.chains import LLMChain
    from langchain.llms import AI21
    from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate



```


```python




    template = """Question: {question}

    Answer: Let's think step by step."""

    prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["question"])



```


```python




    llm = AI21(ai21_api_key=AI21_API_KEY)



```


```python




    llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)



```


```python




    question = "What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Beiber was born?"

    llm_chain.run(question)



```


```python




        '\n1. What year was Justin Bieber born?\nJustin Bieber was born in 1994.\n2. What team won the Super Bowl in 1994?\nThe Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl in 1994.'
