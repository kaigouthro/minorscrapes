# Amazon Textract

Amazon Textract is a machine learning (ML) service that automatically extracts text, handwriting, and data from scanned documents. It goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to
identify, understand, and extract data from forms and tables. Today, many companies manually extract data from scanned documents such as PDFs, images, tables, and forms, or through simple OCR software
that requires manual configuration (which often must be updated when the form changes). To overcome these manual and expensive processes, Textract uses ML to read and process any type of document,
accurately extracting text, handwriting, tables, and other data with no manual effort. You can quickly automate document processing and act on the information extracted, whether youâ€™re automating
loans processing or extracting information from invoices and receipts. Textract can extract the data in minutes instead of hours or days.

This sample demonstrates the use of Amazon Textract in combination with LangChain as a DocumentLoader.

Textract supports PDF, TIFF, PNG and JPEG format.

Check https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/limits-document.html for supported document sizes, languages and characters.

## Sample 1â€‹

The first example uses a local file, which internally will be send to Amazon Textract sync API DetectDocumentText.

Local files or URL endpoints like HTTP:// are limited to one page documents for Textract. Multi-page documents have to reside on S3. This sample file is a jpeg.

```python




    from langchain.document_loaders import AmazonTextractPDFLoader

    loader = AmazonTextractPDFLoader("example_data/alejandro_rosalez_sample-small.jpeg")
    documents = loader.load()



```


```python

## Sample 2â€‹

The next sample loads a file from an HTTPS endpoint. It has to be single page, as Amazon Textract requires all multi-page documents to be stored on S3.

```python




    from langchain.document_loaders import AmazonTextractPDFLoader

    loader = AmazonTextractPDFLoader(
        "https://amazon-textract-public-content.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/langchain/alejandro_rosalez_sample_1.jpg"
    )
    documents = loader.load()



```


```python

## Sample 3â€‹

Processing a multi-page document requires the document to be on S3. The sample document resides in a bucket in us-east-2 and Textract needs to be called in that same region to be successful, so we set
the region_name on the client and pass that in to the loader to ensure Textract is called from us-east-2. You could also to have your notebook running in us-east-2, setting the AWS_DEFAULT_REGION set
to us-east-2 or when running in a different environment, pass in a boto3 Textract client with that region name like in the cell below.

```python




    import boto3

    textract_client = boto3.client("textract", region_name="us-east-2")

    file_path = "s3://amazon-textract-public-content/langchain/layout-parser-paper.pdf"
    loader = AmazonTextractPDFLoader(file_path, client=textract_client)
    documents = loader.load()



```


Now getting the number of pages to validate the response (printing out the full response would be quite long...). We expect 16 pages.

```python




    len(documents)



```


```python




        16



```


## Using the AmazonTextractPDFLoader in an LangChain chain (e. g. OpenAI)â€‹

The AmazonTextractPDFLoader can be used in a chain the same way the other loaders are used. Textract itself does have a Query feature, which offers similar functionality to the QA chain in this
sample, which is worth checking out as well.

```python




    # You can store your OPENAI_API_KEY in a .env file as well
    # import os
    # from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # load_dotenv()



```


```python




    # Or set the OpenAI key in the environment directly
    import os

    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-OpenAI-API-key"



```


```python




    from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI

    chain = load_qa_chain(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="map_reduce")
    query = ["Who are the autors?"]

    chain.run(input_documents=documents, question=query)



```


```python
